# Simple Interactive Turtle Graphics
For CSC 451 Final Project

This is a turtle graphics package for C++ written for my final project in CSC 451.
May not necessarily be very robust, but should be sufficient for purposes of this
course.

This emulates some of the features of turtles found in Python, along with some of 
the movement found in packages such as ComputerCraft turtles.

This makefile builds with freeglut instead glut32, although it can technically be built, 
with either.
